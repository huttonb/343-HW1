# 343-HW1
Homework 1 for CIS 343
Some common git commands that I'll probably be using:
git branch: if I'm working with a team I'll most likely be making a lot of branches so that we can each work on our own seperate branch
git checkout: to change what branch I'm using, 
git add: I probably won't be using this as much in big projects, but when I first add files to the project I'll be using it
git status and git log will be useful for reading what's happening with the repository and seeing any changes that have been made
git commit for commiting changes, this will probably be my most used, if I'm using github a lot.
